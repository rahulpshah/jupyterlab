Extension Development Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* We have rewritten how extensions provide keyboard shortcuts and interact with the settings system. If you previously defined keyboard shortcuts or used the settings mechanism, you will need to update your extension (`#5470 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5470>`__, `#5298 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5298>`__)
* We have renamed the plugin type from ``JupyterLabPlugin`` to ``JupyterFrontEndPlugin``. The application arg is also renamed from ``JupyterLab`` to  ``JupyterFrontEnd`` and some its functionality has been moved to a separate ``ILabShell`` plugin (`#5845 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5845>`__, `#5919 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5919>`__)
* The lab shell ``addToMainArea``, ``addToLeftArea``, ``addToTopArea``, ``addToRightArea``, and ``addToBottomArea`` functions have been replaced with a single ``add()`` function that takes the area as an argument. Replace ``addToMainArea(widget, options)`` with ``add(widget, 'main', options)``, etc. (`#5845 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5845>`__)
* Rename ``pageUrl`` to ``appUrl`` in the server connection (`#6509 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6509>`__, `#6508 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6508>`__, `#6585 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6585>`__, `#6584 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6584>`__)
* ``MainAreaWidget`` instances now forward update requests to their ``content`` (`#6586 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6586>`__, `#6571 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6571>`__)
* The theme data attributes are renamed and moved to the document body element. If you are relying on these attributes in CSS to conditionally style based on the theme, you should update their names. For example ``data-theme-light`` is now ``data-jp-theme-light``.  (`#6566 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6566>`__, `#6554 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6554>`__)
* Extensions which require CSS should no longer import their CSS files into their Javascript files. Instead, they should specify a root CSS file in the ``style`` attribute in their ``package.json``, and JupyterLab will automatically import that CSS file. (`#6533 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6533>`__, `#6530 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6530>`__, `#6395 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6395>`__, `#6390 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6390>`__)
* ``Dialog.prompt`` has been replaced by a number of type-specific dialogs such as ``InputDialog.getString``, ``InputDialog.getBoolean``, etc.  (`#6522 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6522>`__, `#6378 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6378>`__, `#6327 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6327>`__, `#6326 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6326>`__)
* When a ``RenderMime`` widget is re-rendered, the default behavior is to remove any existing content in the DOM. This can be overridden if needed. (`#6513 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6513>`__, `#6505 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6505>`__, `#6497 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6497>`__)
* We have updated our internal TypeScript version to 3.5.1 and our compile target to ``ES2017``. Extensions may need to upgrade their TypeScript version and target as well. (`#6440 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6440>`__, `#6224 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6224>`__)
* We have updated the typings for some of the Kernel messages so that they better match the spec. (`#6433 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6433>`__)
* A ``connectionFailure`` signal has been added to some of the manager classes, which can be used to detect when a connection to the server is lost (`#6399 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6399>`__, `#6176 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6176>`__, `#3324 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3324>`__)
* Add rate limiting and polling utilities to ``coreutils``  to use for throttling and debouncing of API requests (`#6345 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6345>`__, `#6346 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6346>`__, `#6401 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6401>`__, `#6305 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6305>`__, `#6157 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6157>`__, `#6192 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6192>`__, `#6186 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6186>`__, `#6141 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6141>`__, `#3929 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3929>`__, `#6141 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6141>`__, `#3929 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3929>`__, `#6186 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6186>`__, `#6192 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6192>`__, `#6401 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6401>`__ ,`#6305 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6305>`__, `#6157 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6157>`__)
* Require session when instantiating terminal widget (`#6339 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6339>`__, `#5061 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5061>`__)
* Provides a signal to see what items are opened in a directory listing  (`#6270 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6270>`__, `#6269 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6269>`__)
* Ads the ability to add widget above the main work area to a top header area (`#5936 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5936>`__)
* Renames ``contextMenuFirst`` to  ``contextMenuHitTest`` in the ``JupyterFrontEnd`` (`#5932 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5932>`__)
* Removes the ``initialCommand`` arg from the terminal creation command. (`#5916 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5916>`__)
* Adds ``--jp-code-cursor-width0``, ``--jp-code-cursor-width1``, and ``--jp-code-cursor-width2`` variables to the themes to support changing the cursor width if you change the font size  (`#5898 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5898>`__)
* Adds the ability to insert a new item to the toolbar before or after another item (`#5896 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5896>`__, `#5894 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5894>`__)
* Adds the ability for extensions to register new CodeMirror modes (`#5829 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5829>`__)
* We have removed the ``JUPYTERLAB_xxx_LOADER`` Webpack loaders, instead you should use the loader directly in the URL as Webpack supports it (`#5709 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5709>`__, `#4406 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4406>`__)
* Adds the ability to handle fragments for document widgets (`#5630 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5630>`__, `#5599 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5599>`__)
* We have added a  ``@jupyterlab/ui-components`` package that contains reusable React components to be used internally and in extensions. Feel free to use this to create extension UIs with consistent styles (`#5538 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5538>`__)
* The ``showErrorMessage`` function now lets you customize the buttons it uses (`#5513 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5513>`__)
* We now provide helpers for using React components within JupyterLab. If you were previously using ``ReactElementWidget`` you should switch to using ``ReactWidget``. (`#5479 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5479>`__, `#5766 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5766>`__, `#6595 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6595>`__, `#6595 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6595>`__)
* The share link command has been moved to its own extension so that it can be overridden (`#5460 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5460>`__, `#5388 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5388>`__)
* Creating a new services session now requires passing a kernel model instead of a kernel instance (`#6503 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6503>`__, `#6142 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6142>`__)
* We upgraded the Webpack raw file loader. The new version of the raw loader exports ES2015 modules, so this may require changes in extensions that import files using the raw loader. For example, if you did ``require('myfile.md')`` to get the content of `myfile.md` as a string, you now should import it using ES2015 `import` syntax, or use `require('myfile.md').default`.
* Widget factories now can support custom cloning behavior from an optional source widget  (`#6060 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6060>`__, `#6044 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6044>`__)
* We have renamed the type ``InstanceTracker`` to ``WidgetTracker`` (`#6569 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/commit/da8e7bda5eebd22319f59e5abbaaa9917872a7e8>`__).
* In order to add widgets to the main area (e.g. as in the old XKCD extension tutorial), the correct syntax is now ``app.shell.add(widget)`` or ``app.shell.add(widget, 'main')``, see `here <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/da8e7bda5eebd22319f59e5abbaaa9917872a7e8/packages/application/src/shell.ts#L500>`__.

`v0.34.0 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/releases/tag/v0.34.0>`__
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

August 18, 2018
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See the `JupyterLab
0.34.0 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/milestone/16?closed=1>`__
milestone on GitHub for the full list of pull requests and issues closed.


Key Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Notebooks, consoles, and text files now have access to completions for local
  tokens.
* Python 3.5+ is now required to use JupyterLab. Python 2 kernels can still be
  run within JupyterLab.
* Added the pipe (``|``) character as a CSV delimiter option.
* Added "Open From Path..."" to top level ``File`` menu.
* Added "Copy Download Link" to context menu for files.


Changes for Developers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Notebooks, consoles, and text files now have access to completions for local
  tokens. If a text file has a running kernel associated with its path (as
  happens with an attached console), it also gets completions and tooltips from
  that kernel. (`#5049 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5049>`__)
* The ``FileBrowser`` widget has a new constructor option ``refreshInterval``,
  allowing the creator to customize how often the widget polls the storage
  backend. This can be useful to prevent rate-limiting in certain contexts.
  (`#5048 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5048>`__)
* The application shell now gets a pair of CSS data attributes indicating the
  current theme, and whether it is light or dark. Extension authors can write
  CSS rules targeting these to have their extension UI elements respond to the
  application theme. For instance, to write a rule targeting whether the theme
  is overall light or dark, you can use

  .. code:: css

     [data-theme-light="true"] your-ui-class {
       background-color: white;
     }
     [data-theme-light="false"] your-ui-class {
       background-color: black;
     }

  The theme name can also be targeted by writing CSS rules for
  ``data-theme-name``. (`#5078
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5078>`__)
* The ``IThemeManager`` interface now exposes a signal for ``themeChanged``,
  allowing extension authors to react to changes in the theme. Theme extensions
  must also provide a new boolean property ``isLight``, declaring whether they are
  broadly light colored. This data allows third-party extensions to react better
  to the active application theme. (`#5078
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5078>`__)
* Added a patch to update the ``uploads`` for each ``FileBrowserModel`` instantly
  whenever a file upload errors. Previously, the upload that erred was only
  being removed from uploads upon an update. This would allow the status bar
  component and other extensions that use the ``FileBrowserModel`` to be more
  precise. (`#5077 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5077>`__)
* Cell IDs are now passed in the shell message as part of the cell metadata when
  a cell is executed. This helps in developing reactive kernels. (`#5033
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5033>`__)
* The IDs of all deleted cells since the last run cell are now passed as part of
  the cell metadata on execution. The IDs of deleted cells since the last run
  cell are stored as ``deletedCells`` in ``NotebookModel``. This helps in
  developing reactive kernels. (`#5037
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5037>`__)
* The ``ToolbarButton`` in ``apputils`` has been refactored with an API change
  and now uses a React component ``ToolbarButtonComponent``  to render its
  children. It is now a ``div`` with a single ``button`` child, which in turn as
  two ``span`` elements for an icon and text label. Extensions that were using
  the ``className`` options should rename it as ``iconClassName``. The
  ``className`` options still exists, but it used as the CSS class on the
  ``button`` element itself. The API changes were done to accommodate styling
  changes to the button. (`#5117
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117>`__)
* The ``Toolbar.createFromCommand`` function has been replaced by a dedicated
  ``ToolbarButton`` subclass called ``CommandToolbarButton``, that wraps a similarly
  named React component. (`#5117
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117>`__)
* The design and styling of the right and left sidebars tabs has been improved
  to address `#5054 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/50>`__.
  We are now using icons to render tabs for the extensions we ship with
  JupyterLab and extension authors are encouraged to do the same (text labels
  still work). Icon based tabs can be used by removing ``widget.caption`` and
  adding ``widget.iconClass = '<youriconclass> jp-SideBar-tabIcon';``. (`#5117
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117>`__)
* The style of buttons in JupyterLab has been updated to a borderless design.
  (`#5117 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117>`__)
* A new series of helper CSS classes for stying SVG-based icons at different
  sizes has been added: ``jp-Icon``, ``jp-Icon-16``, ``jp-Icon-18``, ``jp-Icon-20``.
* The rank of the default sidebar widget has been updated. The main change is
  giving the extension manager a rank of ``1000`` so that it appears at the end of
  the default items.
* Python 3.5+ is now required to use JupyterLab.  Python 2 kernels can still be
  run within JupyterLab.  (`#5119
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5119>`__)
* JupyterLab now uses ``yarn 1.9.4`` (aliased as ``jlpm``), which now allows uses to
  use Node 10+.  (`#5121
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5121>`__)
* Clean up handling of ``baseUrl`` and ``wsURL`` for ``PageConfig`` and
  ``ServerConnection``.  (`#5111
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5111>`__)


Other Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Added the pipe (``|``) character as a CSV delimiter option. (`#5112
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5112>`__)
* Added ``Open From Path...`` to top level ``File`` menu. (`#5108
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5108>`__)
* Added a ``saveState`` signal to the document context object. (`#5096
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5096>`__)
* Added "Copy Download Link" to context menu for files.  (`#5089
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5089>`__)
* Extensions marked as ``deprecated`` are no longer shown in the extension
  manager.  (`#5058 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5058>`__)
* Remove ``In`` and ``Out`` text from cell prompts. Shrunk the prompt width from
  90px to 64px. In the light theme, set the prompt colors of executed console
  cells to active prompt colors and reduced their opacity to 0.5. In the dark
  theme, set the prompt colors of executed console cells to active prompt colors
  and set their opacity to 1. (`#5097
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5097>`__ and `#5130
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5130>`__)


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Fixed a bug in the rendering of the "New Notebook" item of the command
  palette. (`#5079 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5079>`__)
* We only create the extension manager widget if it is enabled. This prevents
  unnecessary network requests to ``npmjs.com``.
  (`#5075 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5075>`__)
* The ``running`` panel now shows the running sessions at startup.  (`#5118
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5118>`__)
* Double clicking a file in the file browser always opens it rather than
  sometimes selecting it for a rename.  (`#5101
  <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5101>`__)

No longer in beta
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In JupyterLab 0.33, we removed the “Beta” label to better signal that
JupyterLab is ready for users to use on a daily basis. The extension
developer API is still being stabilized. See the release blog post for
details.
(`#4898 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4898>`__,
`#4920 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4920>`__)

Workspaces
^^^^^^^^^^

We added new workspace support, which enables you to have multiple saved
layouts, including in different browser windows. See the
:ref:`workspace documentation <url-workspaces-ui>`
for more details.
(`#4502 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4502>`__,
`#4708 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4708>`__,
`#4088 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4088>`__,
`#4041 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4041>`__
`#3673 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3673>`__,
`#4780 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4780>`__)

Menu items
^^^^^^^^^^

-  “Activate Previously Used Tab” added to the Tab menu
   (``Ctrl/Cmd Shift '``) to toggle between the previously active tabs
   in the main area.
   (`#4296 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4296>`__)
-  “Reload From Disk” added to the File menu to reload an open file from
   the state saved on disk.
   (`#4615 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4615>`__)
-  “Save Notebook with View State” added to the File menu to persist the
   notebook collapsed and scrolled cell state. We now read the
   ``collapsed``, ``scrolled``, ``jupyter.source_hidden`` and
   ``jupyter.outputs_hidden`` notebook cell metadata when opening.
   ``collapsed`` and ``jupyter.outputs_hidden`` are redundant and the
   initial collapsed state is the union of both of them. When the state
   is persisted, if an output is collapsed, both will be written with
   the value ``true``, and if it is not, both will not be written.
   (`#3981 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3981>`__)
-  “Increase/Decrease Font Size” added to the text editor settings menu.
   (`#4811 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4811>`__)
-  “Show in File Browser” added to a document tab’s context menu.
   (`#4500 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4500>`__)
-  “Open in New Browser Tab” added to the file browser context menu.
   (`#4315 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4315>`__)
-  “Copy Path” added to file browser context menu to copy the document’s
   path to the clipboard.
   (`#4582 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4582>`__)
-  “Show Left Area” has been renamed to “Show Left Sidebar” for
   consistency (same for right sidebar).
   (`#3818 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3818>`__)

Keyboard shortcuts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  “Save As…” given the keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl/Cmd Shift S``.
   (`#4560 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4560>`__)
-  “Run All Cells” given the keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl/Cmd Shift Enter``.
   (`#4558 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4558>`__)
-  “notebook:change-to-cell-heading-X” keyboard shortcuts (and commands)
   renamed to “notebook:change-cell-to-heading-X” for X=1…6. This fixes
   the notebook command-mode keyboard shortcuts for changing headings.
   (`#4430 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4430>`__)
-  The console execute shortcut can now be set to either ``Enter`` or
   ``Shift Enter`` as a Console setting.
   (`#4054 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4054>`__)

Command palette items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  “Notebook” added to the command palette to open a new notebook.
   (`#4812 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4812>`__)
-  “Run Selected Text or Current Line in Console” added to the command
   palette to run the selected text or current line from a notebook in a
   console. A default keyboard shortcut for this command is not yet
   provided, but can be added by users with the
   ``notebook:run-in-console`` command. To add a keyboard shortcut
   ``Ctrl G`` for this command, use the “Settings” \| “Advanced Settings
   Editor” menu item to open the “Keyboard Shortcuts” advanced settings,
   and add the following JSON in the shortcut JSON object in the User
   Overrides pane (adjust the actual keyboard shortcut if you wish).
   (`#3453 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3453>`__,
   `#4206 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4206>`__,
   `#4330 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4330>`__)

   .. code:: json

      {
        "command": "notebook:run-in-console",
        "keys": ["Ctrl G"],
        "selector": ".jp-Notebook.jp-mod-editMode"
      }

-  The command palette now renders labels, toggled state, and keyboard
   shortcuts in a more consistent and correct way.
   (`#4533 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4533>`__,
   `#4510 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4510>`__)

Settings

   (`#4445 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4445>`__)

Larger file uploads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Support for larger file uploads (>15MB) when using Jupyter notebook
   server version >= 5.1.
   (`#4224 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4224>`__)

Extension management and installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  New extension manager for installing JupyterLab extensions from npm
   within the JupyterLab UI. You can enable this from the Advanced
   Settings interface.
   (`#4682 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4682>`__,
   `#4925 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4925>`__)
-  Please note that to install extensions in JupyterLab, you must use
   NodeJS version 9 or earlier (i.e., not NodeJS version 10). We will
   upgrade yarn, with NodeJS version 10 support, when a `bug in
   yarn <https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5935>`__ is fixed.
   (`#4804 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4804>`__)

Interface changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Wider tabs in the main working area to show longer filenames.
   (`#4801 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4801>`__)
-  Initial kernel selection for a notebook or console can no longer be
   canceled: the user must select a kernel.
   (`#4596 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4596>`__)
-  Consoles now do not display output from other clients by default. A
   new “Show All Kernel Activity” console context menu item has been
   added to show all activity from a kernel in the console.
   (`#4503 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4503>`__)
-  The favicon now shows the busy status of the kernels in JupyterLab.
   (`#4361 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4361>`__,
   `#3957 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3957>`__,
   `#4966 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4966>`__)

Renderers
^^^^^^^^^

-  JupyterLab now ships with a Vega4 renderer by default (upgraded from
   Vega3).
   (`#4806 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4806>`__)
-  The HTML sanitizer now allows some extra tags in rendered HTML,
   including ``kbd``, ``sup``, and ``sub``.
   (`#4618 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4618>`__)
-  JupyterLab now recognizes the ``.tsv`` file extension as
   tab-separated files.
   (`#4684 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4684>`__)
-  Javascript execution in notebook cells has been re-enabled.
   (`#4515 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4682>`__)

Changes for developers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  A new signal for observing application dirty status state changes.
   (`#4840 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4840>`__)
-  A new signal for observing notebook cell execution.
   (`#4740 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4740>`__,
   `#4744 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4744>`__)
-  A new ``anyMessage`` signal for observing any message a kernel sends
   or receives.
   (`#4437 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4437>`__)
-  A generic way for different widgets to register a “Save with extras”
   command that appears in the File menu under save.
   (`#3981 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3981>`__)
-  A new API for removing groups from a JupyterLab menu. ``addGroup``
   now returns an ``IDisposable`` which can be used to remove the group.
   ``removeGroup`` has been removed.
   (`#4890 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4890>`__)
-  The ``Launcher`` now uses commands from the application
   ``CommandRegistry`` to launch new activities. Extension authors that
   add items to the launcher will need to update them to use commands.
   (`#4757 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4757>`__)
-  There is now a top-level ``addToBottomArea`` function in the
   application, allowing extension authors to add bottom panel items
   like status bars.
   (`#4752 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4752>`__)
-  Rendermime extensions can now indicate that they are the default
   rendered widget factory for a file-type. For instance, the default
   widget for a markdown file is a text editor, but the default rendered
   widget is the markdown viewer.
   (`#4692 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4692>`__)
-  Add new workspace REST endpoints to ``jupyterlab_server`` and make
   them available in ``@jupyterlab/services``.
   (`#4841 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4841>`__)
-  Documents created with a mimerenderer extension can now be accessed
   using an ``IInstanceTracker`` which tracks them. Include the token
   ``IMimeDocumentTracker`` in your plugin to access this. The
   ``IInstanceTracker`` interface has also gained convenience functions
   ``find`` and ``filter`` to simplify iterating over instances.
   (`#4762 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4762>`__)
-  RenderMime render errors are now displayed to the user.
   (`#4465 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4465>`__)
-  ``getNotebookVersion`` is added to the ``PageConfig`` object.
   (`#4224 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4224>`__)
-  The session ``kernelChanged`` signal now contains both the old kernel
   and the new kernel to make it easy to unregister things from the old
   kernel.
   (`#4834 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4834>`__)
-  The ``connectTo`` functions for connecting to kernels and sessions
   are now synchronous (returning a connection immediately rather than a
   promise). The DefaultSession ``clone`` and ``update`` methods are
   also synchronous now.
   (`#4725 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4725>`__)
-  Kernel message processing is now asynchronous, which guarantees the
   order of processing even if a handler is asynchronous. If a kernel
   message handler returns a promise, kernel message processing is
   paused until the promise resolves. The kernel’s ``anyMessage`` signal
   is emitted synchronously when a message is received before
   asynchronous message handling, and the ``iopubMessage`` and
   ``unhandledMessage`` signals are emitted during asynchronous message
   handling. These changes mean that the comm ``onMsg`` and ``onClose``
   handlers and the kernel future ``onReply``, ``onIOPub``, and
   ``onStdin`` handlers, as well as the comm target and message hook
   handlers, may be asynchronous and return promises.
   (`#4697 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697>`__)
-  Kernel comm targets and message hooks now are unregistered with
   ``removeCommTarget`` and ``removeMessageHook``, instead of using
   disposables. The corresponding ``registerCommTarget`` and
   ``registerMessageHook`` functions now return nothing.
   (`#4697 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697>`__)
-  The kernel ``connectToComm`` function is synchronous, and now returns
   the comm rather than a promise to the comm.
   (`#4697 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697>`__)
-  The ``KernelFutureHandler`` class ``expectShell`` constructor
   argument is renamed to ``expectReply``.
   (`#4697 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697>`__)
-  The kernel future ``done`` returned promise now resolves to undefined
   if there is no reply message.
   (`#4697 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697>`__)
-  The ``IDisplayDataMsg`` is updated to have the optional ``transient``
   key, and a new ``IUpdateDisplayDataMsg`` type was added for update
   display messages.
   (`#4697 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697>`__)
-  The ``uuid`` function from ``@jupyterlab/coreutils`` is removed.
   Instead import ``UUID`` from ``@phosphor/coreutils`` and use
   ``UUID.uuid4()`` .
   (`#4604 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4604>`__)
-  Main area widgets like the launcher and console inherit from a common
   ``MainAreaWidget`` class which provides a content area (``.content``)
   and a toolbar (``.toolbar``), consistent focus handling and
   activation behavior, and a spinner displayed until the given
   ``reveal`` promise is resolved. Document widgets, like the notebook
   and text editor and other documents opened from the document manager,
   implement the ``IDocumentWidget`` interface (instead of
   ``DocumentRegistry.IReadyWidget``), which builds on
   ``MainAreaWidget`` and adds a ``.context`` attribute for the document
   context and makes dirty handling consistent. Extension authors may
   consider inheriting from the ``MainAreaWidget`` or ``DocumentWidget``
   class for consistency. Several effects from these changes are noted
   below.
   (`#3499 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3499>`__,
   `#4453 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4453>`__)

   -  The notebook panel ``.notebook`` attribute is renamed to
      ``.content``.
   -  The text editor is now the ``.content`` of a ``DocumentWidget``,
      so the top-level editor widget has a toolbar and the editor itself
      is ``widget.content.editor`` rather than just ``widget.editor``.
   -  Mime documents use a ``MimeContent`` widget embedded inside of a
      ``DocumentWidget`` now.
   -  Main area widgets and document widgets now have a ``revealed``
      promise which resolves when the widget has been revealed (i.e.,
      the spinner has been removed). This should be used instead of the
      ``ready`` promise.

Changes in the JupyterLab code infrastructure include:

-  The JupyterLab TypeScript codebase is now compiled to ES2015 (ES6)
   using TypeScript 2.9. We also turned on the TypeScript
   ``esModuleInterop`` flag to enable more natural imports from
   non-es2015 JavaScript modules. With the update to ES2015 output, code
   generated from async/await syntax became much more manageable, so we
   have started to use async/await liberally throughout the codebase,
   especially in tests. Because we use Typedoc for API documentation, we
   still use syntax compatible with TypeScript 2.7 where Typedoc is
   used. Extension authors may have some minor compatibility updates to
   make. If you are writing an extension in TypeScript, we recommend
   updating to TypeScript 2.9 and targeting ES2015 output as well.

   `#4797 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4797>`__)
-  The JupyterLab codebase is now formatted using
   `Prettier <https://github.com/prettier/prettier>`__. By default the
   development environment installs a pre-commit hook that formats your
   staged changes.
   (`#4090 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4090>`__)

   `#4698 <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4698>`__)
-  Upgraded yarn to version 1.6. Please note that you must use NodeJS
   version 9 or earlier with JupyterLab (i.e., not NodeJS version 10).
   We will upgrade yarn, with NodeJS version 10 support, when a `bug in
   yarn <https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5935>`__ is fixed.

Mainly backend-focused release with compatibility with Phosphor 1.0 and
